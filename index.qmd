::: {.notes}
- My name is Stephanie Zimmer
- Senior Reasearch Statistician at RTI international
- My role includes working on large surveys - sampling design, weighting, overseeing data production
- My day-to-day includes lots of management-ish stuff and meetings but I still code quite a bit
:::


## My personal coding journey


- NC State University: Bachelor's in Statistics included SAS and MATLAB

- Iowa State University: PhD in Statistics included R

- RTI: Research statistician, back to learning SAS, still using R

:::{.notes}
- No programming exposure in high school
- Various stats SAS classes, one math modeling course. 
- Learned R before the tidyverse
- RTI sent me to SAS classes, learned quickly with a community of experts

## My human language journey

- Native English speaker with Native English parents {{< fa child >}}

- Studied German in high school for 3 years {{< fa book >}} {{< fa school >}}

- Began learning Spanish in 2020 {{< fa mobile >}} {{< fa laptop >}}  {{< fa people-group >}}

::: {.notes}
- German: chose to learn because my grandmother was from Germany. My mother could also speak German yet never taught it to me. Outside of them, not too useful. No community

- Spanish: my husband's mother's primary language was Spanish. We were spending more time with her and I wanted to be able to understand more when she was speaking with him. In my every day life, I encounter people speaking Spanish - grocery store, restaurants, travel, and more

- Started with Duolingo

- Took a small online adult class with El Centro Hispano based in my city of Durham, NC

- Began to listen more at home, try to speak
:::

## Team change toward open-source first

- Stats team wants to take open-source first approach

- Stats team primarily uses SAS currently

- I love R and this is scary!

:::{.notes}
- Reflecting on how my human language journey parallels with RTI's organizational change
- I said I would learn Spanish for many years before I sat down and did it in 2020
- I had a strong motivator - my husband's mother
- Learning alone on Duolingo only got me so far, had to add a real teacher and community experience
:::

# Our training approach

## Self-paced learning

- Curated list of free learning resources

- Paid subscriptions to learning platforms

:::{.notes}
- Self-paced learning works well for basics
- Learning platforms are mostly virtual and big hurdle was "OK, how do I do this on MY computer with MY data?"
:::

## Webinars showing off open-source

- These were not tutorials

- Provided demos, resources, and examples

- Very good for demonstrating workflows common to our group

:::{.notes}
- We don't do much modeling
- Mostly data cleaning, sampling, weighting
:::

## Create cohort of mentors

- Staff with open-source experience

- Mentors were not all advanced users

- Mentors monitored an email, Slack channel, and Yammer pages for questions

- Mentors hosted office hours (see next slides)

## Office hours (1.0)

- Started to fill in the gap of self-paced learning

- Intention: staff bring questions

- Reality: mentors have topics in their back pocket

- Not recorded

:::{.notes}
- Lots of discussion of how SAS & R *think* differently, vector operations vs program data vector
- Initially thought recording would scare people into NOT asking questions
- Had lots of lurkers/observers/wallflowers
- People couldn't consistently attend and kept wanting to go back to basics
:::

## Office hours (2.0)

- Mentors prepare material, lean towards tutorials

- Recorded

- Materials shared on enterprise GitHub (sneaky way to try to push this too...)

- Created a mini project of work similar to our team's typical tasks

:::{.notes}
- reduced frequency from twice a week to once a week
- email sent out ahead with topic planned for the day
- allowed asycnhronous participation (complicated scheduling)
- feedback that people are having trouble mapping generic training to their every day work
- this is where we are now for office hours, lots of engagement
:::

# Conversion approach

## Pilot projects

- Small set of projects/tasks converted

- More detail in: [useR 2025 - Navigating the Transition: Lessons from Adopting an Open-Source Approach - Carlos Petzold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPH76v0d8Wo)

## Demonstrate success

- Show off projects already using open-source or recently converted

- Have staff discuss their experiences

:::{.notes}
- Demonstrate tasks (not even full projects) that are using R
- Use staff that already know R (mostly earlier career staff)
:::

## Building our own tools

- In-house package developed for codebook creation

- Package developed for survey sampling, [SampleSelectR](https://github.com/RTIInternational/SampleSelectR)

- Cheatsheets for comparing R and SAS for common tasks

- AI tool made specifically for SAS to R conversion
