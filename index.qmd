::: {.notes}
- My name is Stephanie Zimmer
- Senior Research Statistician at RTI international. RTI is an independent, research institute that provides research and technical services to government and commercial clients. Statistics is at the core of RTI. Gertrude Cox established the Statistics Research Division at RTI in 1958
- My role includes working on large surveys - sampling design, weighting, overseeing data production
- My day-to-day includes lots of management-ish stuff and meetings but I still code quite a bit
- My stats group works on official statistics - censuses, surveys, and administrative data projects
- Sampling, weighting, data cleaning, and analysis

## Team change toward open-source first

- Stats team wants to take open-source first approach

- Stats team primarily using SAS

- I love R and this is scary!

:::{.notes}
- No need to sell you on R! At my company, we're exploring a move to open-source first for our statistical work
- How this impacts our staff and our clients
- Reflecting on how both my programming and human language journey parallels with RTI's organizational change
- Staff are wanting skills that keep them current - marketable internally and externally
:::

## TLDR

- A bit of my personal journey

- Our training approach

- Our conversion approach

:::{.notes}
- Community
- Motivation
- Tooling
:::

## My personal coding journey


- NC State University: Bachelor's in Statistics included SAS and MATLAB

- Iowa State University: PhD in Statistics included R

- RTI: Research statistician, back to learning SAS, still using R

:::{.notes}
- No programming exposure in high school
- Various stats SAS classes, one math modeling course. 
- Learned R before the tidyverse
- RTI sent me to SAS classes, learned quickly with a community of experts
:::

## My human language journey

- Native English speaker with Native English parents {{< fa child >}}

- Studied German in high school for 3 years {{< fa book >}} {{< fa school >}}

- Began learning Spanish in 2020 {{< fa mobile >}} {{< fa laptop >}}  {{< fa people-group >}} 

::: {.notes}
- German: chose to learn because my grandmother was from Germany. My mother could also speak German yet never taught it to me. Outside of them, not too useful. No community

- Spanish: Always wanted to learn, very useful in the US. I kept saying I was going to learn it. Mañana, mañana, mañana. It wasn't happening

- my husband's mother's primary language was Spanish. We were spending more time with her and I wanted to be able to understand more when she was speaking with him. In my every day life, I encounter people speaking Spanish - grocery store, restaurants, travel, and more

- Started with Duolingo. Learning alone on Duolingo only got me so far, had to add a real teacher and community experience

- Took a small online adult class with El Centro Hispano based in my city of Durham, NC

- Began to listen more at home, try to speak

- Reflecting on my journey learning Spanish, I saw a lot of parallels with successful learning of R

- Motivation is important

- Online learning only gets you so far

- Community is important

# Our training approach

## Self-paced learning

- Curated list of free learning resources

- Paid subscriptions to learning platforms

:::{.notes}
- Self-paced learning works well for basics
- Learning platforms are mostly virtual and big hurdle was "OK, how do I do this on MY computer with MY data?"
:::

## Webinars showing off open-source

- These were not tutorials

- Provided demos, resources, and examples

- Very good for demonstrating workflows common to our group

:::{.notes}
- We don't do much modeling
- Mostly data cleaning, sampling, weighting, descriptive analysis of surveys
:::

## Create cohort of mentors

- Staff with open-source experience

- Mentors were not all advanced users

- Mentors monitored an email, Slack channel, and Yammer pages for questions

- Mentors hosted office hours

:::{.notes}
- Mentor group is VERY enthusiastic, we've got a Teams channel going and discuss successes and questions for each other regularly

- Office hours were our biggest success with mentors which I will detail
:::

## Office hours (1.0)

- Started to fill in the gap of self-paced learning

- Intention: staff bring questions

- Reality: mentors have topics in their back pocket

- Not recorded

:::{.notes}
- Twice a week
- Lots of discussion of how SAS & R *think* differently, vector operations vs program data vector
- Initially thought recording would scare people into NOT asking questions
- Add opportunities of learning for introverts and extroverts
- Had lots of lurkers/observers/wallflowers
- People couldn't consistently attend and kept wanting to go back to basics
:::

## Office hours (2.0)

- Mentors prepare material, lean towards tutorials

- Recorded

- Materials shared on enterprise GitHub (sneaky way to try to push this too...)

- Created a mini project of work similar to our team's typical tasks

:::{.notes}
- reduced frequency from twice a week to once a week
- email sent out ahead with topic planned for the day
- allowed asycnhronous participation (complicated scheduling)
- feedback that people are having trouble mapping generic training to their every day work
- this is where we are now for office hours, lots of engagement
:::

# Conversion approach

## Pilot projects

- Small set of projects/tasks converted

- More detail in: [useR 2025 - Navigating the Transition: Lessons from Adopting an Open-Source Approach - Carlos Petzold](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPH76v0d8Wo)

:::{.notes}
- Some lessons learn included online trainings being too generic, some experienced staff should've started a bit of set-up with folks, open-ended "ask if you need" help didn't work
- What worked well: paired programming, small group with specific training/examples, AI tools and StackOverflow
- Most new R users could work independently by the end of pilot
:::


## Demonstrate success

- Show off projects already using open-source or recently converted

- Have staff discuss their experiences

:::{.notes}
- Demonstrate tasks (not even full projects) that are using R
- Use staff that already know R (mostly earlier career staff)
- Show side by side deliverables
- Discussed staff mix used - senior staff with SAS experience and junior staff with R experience
:::

## Building our own tools

- In-house package developed for codebook creation

- Package developed for survey sampling, [SampleSelectR](https://github.com/RTIInternational/SampleSelectR)

- Cheatsheets for comparing R and SAS for common tasks

- Internal AI tool made specifically for SAS to R conversion

:::{.notes}
- From our surveys and admin data, our key deliverables are data - describe these datasets with codebooks/data dictionaries
- No package exactly met our need so a team adapted a package to add some more customization including question wording and more handling of missing values
- SampleSelectR: developed by RTI staff to handle complex survey sampling tasks common to our work
- Cheatsheets: e.g., how to do merges in R vs SAS, common math/stats functions, transposing/pivoting, regression, and more. Making summary tables. Exporting nicely formatted tables to Excel
- Analogy to writing a report in English and using AI to translate without review
:::

# Closing

## Hindsight 

- Produce materials that are company specific

- Provide more structure in office hours

- Start as early as possible but training should be very closely timed to implementation

:::{.notes}
- installing R/RStudio, setting up GitHub, connecting to databases on YOUR systems
- planned topics, mini projects
:::


## Final thoughts

- Change is hard!

- Community makes things better

- Learn what motivates people

- Keep listening to learners
