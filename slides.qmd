- German: chose to learn because my grandmother was from Germany. My mother could also speak German yet never taught it to me. Outside of them, not too useful. No community

- Spanish: my husband's mother's primary language was Spanish. We were spending more time with her and I wanted to be able to understand more when she was speaking with him. In my every day life, I encounter people speaking Spanish - grocery store, restaurants, travel, and more

- Started with Duolingo

- Took a small online adult class with El Centro Hispano based in my city of Durham, NC

- Began to listen more at home, try to speak
