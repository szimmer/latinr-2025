RTI is an independent, research institute that provides research and technical services to government and commercial clients. Statistics is at the core of RTI. Gertrude Cox established the Statistics Research Division at RTI in 1958\nMy role includes working on large surveys - sampling design, weighting, overseeing data production\nMy day-to-day includes lots of management-ish stuff and meetings but I still code quite a bit\nMy stats group works on official statistics - censuses, surveys, and administrative data projects\nSampling, weighting, data cleaning, and analysis"

My mother could also speak German yet never taught it to me. Outside of them, not too useful. No community\nSpanish: Always wanted to learn, very useful in the US. I kept saying I was going to learn it. Mañana, mañana, mañana. It wasn’t happening\nmy husband’s mother’s primary language was Spanish. We were spending more time with her and I wanted to be able to understand more when she was speaking with him. In my every day life, I encounter people speaking Spanish - grocery store, restaurants, travel, and more\nStarted with Duolingo. Learning alone on Duolingo only got me so far, had to add a real teacher and community experience\nTook a small online adult class with El Centro Hispano based in my city of Durham, NC\nBegan to listen more at home, try to speak\nReflecting on my journey learning Spanish, I saw a lot of parallels with successful learning of R\nMotivation is important\nOnline learning only gets you so far\nCommunity is important"
